        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <div class="about_text">
            <p>  Learning the basics of computer programming is not only fun and interesting to the folks but gives them a window to future paths that will be open to them. Some people 
                are saying that along with foreign languages, coding is a language needed for jobs of the 
                future.
                
                The members will use different programs to begin to learn to code.The members will also be using code to program a robot to maneuver through an obstacle or perform a feat. A program dedicated to the idea that all members can benefit from learning about computational thinking. Coding Club helps members gain in-depth knowledge of coding. This helps them immensely during placements and can also bring laurels to the institution through various national and international programming contests.
                
                The club helps members develop an aptitude for logical thinking and visualizing a problem from various perspectives and creating multiple innovative solutions. The country as a whole  requires a lot more coders for it to achieve the goal of a ‘Digital India’.

                ACTIVITIES:
                Conquer Code-
                This was a competitive coding event different than the usual ones. The participants are given 
                three questions which involved logical problem statements. Based on these, they have to design the code to get the required output. Participants are allowed to code in different languages like C, C++, JAVA, etc. based on the participants’ preferences.
                Web Weaving-
                Web Weaving is a 2 hours event where computer programmers involved ingraphic
                designing, web design and development. The idea us to get coding done in an extreme manner, to 
                be started from scratch and end with a working prototype with in the 2 hours.
